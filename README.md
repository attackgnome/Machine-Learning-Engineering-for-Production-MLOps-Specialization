Course work for Coursera's Machine Learning Engineering for Production Specialization by DeepLearning.ai. 

I wanted to have a place to store all of the relevant course work so that I could refer back on it as needed in the future. 

The courses are as follows: (Descriptions taken from https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops#courses )

## COURSE 1
### Introduction to Machine Learning in Production

In the first course of Machine Learning Engineering for Production Specialization, you will identify the various components and design an ML production system end-to-end: project scoping, data needs, modeling strategies, and deployment constraints and requirements; and learn how to establish a model baseline, address concept drift, and prototype the process for developing, deploying, and continuously improving a productionized ML application.

Understanding machine learning and deep learning concepts is essential, but if you’re looking to build an effective AI career, you need production engineering capabilities as well. Machine learning engineering for production combines the foundational concepts of machine learning with the functional expertise of modern software development and engineering roles to help you develop production-ready skills. 

Week 1: Overview of the ML Lifecycle and Deployment  
Week 2: Selecting and Training a Model  
Week 3: Data Definition and Baseline

## COURSE 2
### Machine Learning Data Lifecycle in Production

In the second course of Machine Learning Engineering for Production Specialization, you will build data pipelines by gathering, cleaning, and validating datasets and assessing data quality; implement feature engineering, transformation, and selection with TensorFlow Extended and get the most predictive power out of your data; and establish the data lifecycle by leveraging data lineage and provenance metadata tools and follow data evolution with enterprise data schemas.

## COURSE 4
### Deploying Machine Learning Models in Production

In the fourth course of Machine Learning Engineering for Production Specialization, you will learn how to deploy ML models and make them available to end-users. You will build scalable and reliable hardware infrastructure to deliver inference requests both in real-time and batch depending on the use case. You will also implement workflow automation and progressive delivery that complies with current MLOps practices to keep your production system running. Additionally,  you will continuously monitor your system to detect model decay, remediate performance drops, and avoid system failures so it can continuously operate at all times.
